# Sets in Python

Set is an unordered and immutable data structure in Python. However, you can insert or delete items in one set.

Sets cannot have duplicated elements.

## Set methods to add and remove items
#### add()
Adds a new item to a set

#### remove()
Removes the given item from the set


## Operations with sets

#### union()
Union operation returns all elements in Set A **and** in Set B.

#### intersection()
Intersection operation returns values that are in both set A and set B.

#### difference()
Difference operation returns all elements which belong to A but not to B.

#### symmetric_difference()
Symmetric difference returns elements which are either in set A or in set B but not in both.
