# Oriented object programming

Oriented object programming (OOP) is progamming paradigm based in "objects":
- Classes: Data types defined by the user
- Objects: Are instances of classes that have individual data. A unique class can have several Objects.
- Methods: Are functions inside the class. It describes the objects' behavior.
- Attributes: Represent different features of the class.

## OOP main principles:
### Inheritance
When one class "inherits" all methods and properties from another class
- Child class: The class that inherits the information.
- Parent class: The base class. The class where the information in inherited from.
### Polymorphism
Different classes and objects are able to perform the same operation.

### Abstraction
An abstract class and methods force the child class to override its methods that are abstract in the parent class.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of making data and methods protected inside objects. Although Python has no mechanism to make data private, there is a naming convention with _ when information should be private.
