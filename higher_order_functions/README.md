# Higher Order Functions
Higher Order Functions are functions that contains other functions as a parameter or returns a function.

- You can create custom Higher Order Functions.

- Python already has some built-in Higher Order Functions.

## Built-in Higher Order Functions
#### map()
Applies the given function to all elements of the iterable, and returns a map_object which is also an iterable.

#### filter()
Filters an iterable when the result of a function passed as a parameter is true. Returns an iterable filter_object.

#### reduce()
This function reduces an iterable to a single value. The given iterable is reduced to only a single integer or string or boolean after manipulated by the given function.
